## 🚀 Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [C++](https://cplusplus.com/)
- [Programming in QT - Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/)

## 💻 Project

Simple project for desktop programmed in C++ developed using Qt which is a software for creating graphical user interfaces and multiplatform applications. The main purpose of the project is to establish programming concepts in C++ along with the use of QT, but its objective is to be able to deliver to the user a basic interface for manipulation and visualization of the three main basic functions of trigonometry: sine, cosine and tangent.

## 📁 Features

- [x] Plotting trigonometric curves:
  - [X] Sine 
  - [X] Cosine 
  - [X] Tangent  
- [X] Overlay for comparison between graphs  
- [X] Possibility to enable or disable certain graphics or all
- [X] Changing plot parameters at runtime:
  - [X] Frequency
  - [X] Execution speed
  - [X] Angle update rate
  - [X] Amplitude
- [X] Shortcuts
